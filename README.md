1. A calculator, an on screen calculator. Project given by The-Odin-Project.
2. Process:
3. written html layout first.
4. spent some time with calculator layout in css and flex come in handy.still haven't learn about grid.
5. wasting rewrite javascript cause focusing too much on playing with tinkering the addEventListener.
6. tried using onclick written in the html for easy coding in javaScript.
7. rewrote the code by converting them to using addEventListener plus using 'data-value' for easy grabbing value from html to javaScript.

????
8. Still have no idea the difference between textContent and value. Already forgot what I read about these two.
